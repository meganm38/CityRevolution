## Proposal

### What will this application do?
This application is a simulation of building a 2-D city. Users/players act as the planner and leader of a city and
build it from scratch. Players can choose to add a variety of 'contents' to a city such as hotels, restaurants, 
and banks and **even citizens** to build a successful town. Players will also implement the
functionality of each content so that their cities ara almost like real!


### Who will use this application?
- Players interact with this application to build a city.
- Admin can add more features to the game. 

### Why is this project of interest to me?
I have always been a fan of simulation games on Steam and enjoyed the immersive experience of building a life and living
out many aspects of it, so I hope to design such a project where I can control what goes on behind the screens!
