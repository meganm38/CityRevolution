## Proposal

### What will this application do?
This application is a simulation of building a 2-D city. Users/players act as the planner and leader of a city and
build it from scratch. Players can choose to add a variety of 'contents' to a city such as **hotels, restaurants, 
grocery stores and residents** to build a successful town. Players will also implement the
functionality of each content so that their cities ara almost like real!


### Who will use this application?
- Players interact with this application to build a city.
- Admin can add more features to the game. 

### Why is this project of interest to me?
I have always been a fan of simulation games on Steam and enjoyed the immersive experience of building a life and living
out many aspects of it, so I hope to design such a project where I can control what goes on behind the screens!

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to create multiple cities.
- As a user, I want to be able to select a city that I have created and add contents to that city such as hotels
  and residents.
- As a user, I want to be able to select a content that I have added to a city and manipulate its functionality. 
  For example, with a hotel, I want to be able to hire residents as staff, create hotel rooms, book residents into hotel rooms, etc.
- As a user, I want to be able to view all the contents that I have added to a city, and view the status of each content that I have created. 
  For example, I want to be able to see information about each of my residents, or the room booking status of a hotel.
- As a user, I want to be able to make my residents work at the businesses that I have created and earn money. Employees
  should automatically receive their wages in their bank accounts.
